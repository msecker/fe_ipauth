# cat=basic; type=string; label=DEBUG / Simulate IP: This allows you to simulate an IP. Fill in an IPv4 or an IPv6 address and every hit in the FE will look like it would come from this IP. This only works if the real originating IP is listed in devIPmask. (Notice: You will be logged out of the BE after first hitting the FE, as the current BE session will get invalidated by simulating another IP)
