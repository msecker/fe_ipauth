# fe_ipauth
based on fe_ipauth 0.0.1, Bernhard Kraft

This version should be compatible with TYPO3 6.2. Some pathes are refactored and the extension makes use of namespaces.

The version changed to 0.2.0, this extension/fork is no longer compatible with older TYPO3 versions (v4)

Feel free to fork for further improvements, fixes, updates

# Notice
Maybe you also want autologin, a modified version for TYPO3 6.x can be found here
